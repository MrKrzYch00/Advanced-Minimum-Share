This is an old Visual Basic script I wrote when I was 15 years old.

It was run in Direct Connect Hub's scripting engine.

It provided such functionality as:
- GUI as separate program Tab,
- Minimum share settings that could be enforced by current day time or server load (users online),
- a lot of other stuff I can't remember anymore.
